A SimHub plugin that communicates directly with MOZA Racing hardware over serial, providing full hardware configuration and LED control through SimHub's native device and effects system.

Built using the amazing work of [Boxflat](https://github.com/Lawstorant/boxflat) that reverse-engineered the [MOZA serial protocol](docs/moza-protocol.md).

## Why This Exists

MOZA makes excellent sim racing hardware, but their companion software — Pithouse — is Windows-only. Linux users have no official way to manage LED effects or stream telemetry to your wheel's dashboard. SimHub, on the other hand, runs on Linux (via Proton/Wine), opening the door for cross-platform hardware control with built-in telemetry support.

The goal is to expand the functionality of MOZA devices to a wider audience by providing tools that work across multiple platforms.  

**Expect a lot of updates in the coming weeks. Feedback and issues are appreciated.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Close Pithouse before using this plugin.** Both applications communicate with MOZA hardware over the same serial port and cannot be open simultaneously. Pithouse must be fully closed (not just minimized) before SimHub can connect.

## Installation

Download the latest `MozaPlugin_v*.zip` from the [Releases](https://github.com/giantorth/moza-simhub-plugin/releases) page and extract into your SimHub installation directory:

- `MozaPlugin.dll` — copy to the SimHub root directory

Restart SimHub — the plugin appears under Settings > Plugins as "MOZA Control".

**Development builds.** The latest in-progress build from the `dev` branch is published as a pre-release: [MozaPlugin_dev.zip](https://github.com/giantorth/moza-simhub-plugin/releases/download/dev-latest/MozaPlugin_dev.zip). Expect bugs or broken features — use the stable release above if you need something reliable.

**Device setup:** Connect your hardware and restart SimHub. The plugin auto-detects connected devices (wheel model, dashboard) and deploys matching device definitions. A banner in the plugin settings panel will prompt you to restart SimHub, after which the devices appear under Devices ready to add. Requires SimHub 9.11+.

## Features

### SimHub Device Integration

MOZA wheels and dashboards register as native SimHub devices, appearing in SimHub's **Devices** section. This enables full control of your LEDs through SimHub's effects pipeline — no separate telemetry mode needed.

![Device Panel](docs/Device.png)

- **Per-Model Device Definitions** — Each new wheel attached will get a generated device definition with the LED layout baked in. Definitions are deployed automatically on first detection — just connect your hardware, restart SimHub, and add the device. Requires SimHub 9.11+
- **LED Effects System** — Use SimHub's full Button and Telemetry effects configuration UI (RPM indicators, flags, speed limiter animations, scripted effects, etc.) to control your wheel and dashboard LEDs
- **Per-Game Device Profiles** — SimHub's device profile system saves and restores LED effect configurations per game
- **Model-Aware Connection** — Only the device matching the currently connected wheel reports as connected. Swap wheels and the correct device activates automatically
- **Separate Wheel & Dashboard Devices** — Each registers independently with its own profile and LED configuration
- **Individual LED Effects (Combined mode)** — SimHub per-LED effects are supported when the wheel device is set to Combined paddle mode. The virtual driver exposes RPM + button LEDs as one contiguous sequence (telemetry first, then buttons) so per-LED effects can target the whole strip

![LED Effects Configuration](docs/Leds.png)

The plugin injects virtual LED drivers so SimHub's effects UI shows each device as connected, even though MOZA uses a proprietary serial protocol. The computed LED colors are forwarded to the hardware each frame.

![Effects List](docs/Effects.png)

SimHub contains many effects to choose from and this plugin supports any custom effects that target a device.

Tested:
- Old-protocol wheels (ES series)
- R5 Base
- Moza handbrake (directly attached)
- New-protocol wheels (Vision GS / GS V2P / TSW / KS Pro / CS Pro)
- Dashboard telemetry + screen updates (confirmed on Vision GS and CS Pro)

TBD:
- Stand alone dashboards
- Older generation wheels


### Per-Model LED Configuration

Each wheel model has a dedicated SimHub device definition with the correct LED layout. The plugin detects the connected wheel model via firmware queries and deploys the matching definition on first detection.

| Device Name | Model Prefix | RPM | Buttons | Flags | Button Mapping |
|-------------|:------------:|:---:|:-------:|:-----:|----------------|
| MOZA GS V2 Pro | GS V2P | 10 | 10 | No | Contiguous (5 left + 5 right) |
| MOZA CS V2 | CS V2.1 | 10 | 6 | No | Non-contiguous: positions 1,2,4,7,9,10 |
| MOZA CS Pro | W17 | 18 | 14 | No | Contiguous |
| MOZA KS Pro | W18 | 18 | 14 | No | RPM strip 3/12/3 (flags merged into RPM sequence) |
| MOZA KS | KS | 10 | 10 | No | Contiguous |
| MOZA FSR V2 | FSR2 | 10 | 14 | Yes | Contiguous |
| MOZA Vision GS | VGS | 10 | 8 | No | Contiguous |
| MOZA TSW | TSW | 10 | 14 | No | Contiguous |
| MOZA Racing Wheel | *(generic)* | 10 | 14 | No | Contiguous (fallback for unknown models) |
| MOZA Old Protocol Wheel | *(ES wheels)* | 10 | 0 | No | RPM LEDs only |
| MOZA Dashboard | — | 10 | 0 | Yes | RPM + flag LEDs |

On wheels with flag LEDs (FSR V2), SimHub sees a single combined telemetry strip laid out as `[flag 1-3][RPM 1-N][flag 4-6]`. Configure flag zones in SimHub's effects UI on those slots.

If your wheel model isn't listed or incorrect, the generic "MOZA Racing Wheel" definition is deployed. Check the SimHub log for the `[Moza] Wheel model:` line and report the model name string so a dedicated definition can be added.

### Dashboard Support

Wheels with an LCD dashboard (Vision GS and CS Pro confirmed; others likely work) can receive live telemetry from SimHub — speed, RPM, gear, lap times, fuel, tyre wear, and so on — streamed via MOZA's multi-tier binary telemetry protocol.

**Important caveats of the current implementation:**

- **You must provide the same `.mzdash` file currently loaded on the wheel.** The plugin streams game data into the wheel's active dashboard layout as-is; it does not install, switch, or author layouts. Build or edit layouts in the official MOZA dashboard builder and flash them to the wheel through Pithouse first, then pick the matching layout from the Dashboard dropdown on the wheel device page (or use "Load .mzdash…" to point at the file you flashed). If the channel bindings don't match, the displayed values will be wrong.
- **SimHub dashboards are not supported.** MOZA wheels render their LCD through firmware using MOZA's proprietary dashboard format. This plugin only streams game data into that format — it cannot push SimHub dashboard templates, HTML overlays, or custom layouts to the screen. Continue using the official MOZA dashboard builder for layout work.
- **Channel mapping.** The wheel device page has a "Channel mappings" expander to override which SimHub property drives each dashboard channel. Leave blank to use the plugin's built-in default mapping.

### Per-Game Profiles

All settings are stored per-game via SimHub's profile system and switch automatically when you launch a different game. A profile selector sits at the top of the plugin panel.

### Hardware Configuration

The plugin panel (Settings > Plugins > MOZA Control) exposes read/write control of wheelbase, wheel, handbrake, and pedal settings — rotation angle, FFB strength, damping, wheelbase/game effects, FFB equalizer, output curves, paddle modes, handbrake modes, pedal calibration — mirroring what Pithouse offers. Tabs auto-show/hide based on what's connected. The Diagnostics tab dumps live wheel identity, dashboard state, and session info for bug reports.

### SimHub Properties

The plugin exposes these properties for use in SimHub dashboards and overlays:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `Moza.BaseConnected` | bool | Wheelbase connection status |
| `Moza.McuTemp` | double | MCU temperature (°C) |
| `Moza.MosfetTemp` | double | MOSFET temperature (°C) |
| `Moza.MotorTemp` | double | Motor temperature (°C) |
| `Moza.BaseState` | int | Wheelbase state |
| `Moza.FfbStrength` | int | FFB strength (%) |
| `Moza.MaxAngle` | int | Max steering angle (degrees) |
