### Session `0x02` — channel catalog (wheel → host)

The wheel advertises which telemetry channels it can decode by streaming
a TLV-encoded **channel catalog** on session `0x02` immediately after
session opens. The host uses this list to filter its outgoing tier
definition (drop channels the wheel doesn't know about) and to present
the user with a per-wheel channel list in the SimHub UI.

### TLV stream layout

```
[0xff]                                              — sentinel / reset marker
[0x03] [04 00 00 00] [01 00 00 00]                 — config param (value=1, constant)
[0x04] [size: u32 LE] [ch_index: u8] [url: ASCII]  — per-channel entry (repeated)
[0x06] [04 00 00 00] [total_channels: u32 LE]      — end marker with channel count
```

| Tag | Field | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------|
| `0xff` | sentinel | Single-byte reset marker; signals "channel catalog stream begins" |
| `0x03` | config param | 4-byte length + 4-byte LE u32 value. Always `1` from wheel (see [`tag-03-config-param.md`](tag-03-config-param.md)) |
| `0x04` | channel entry | 4-byte length + 1-byte channel index + UTF-8 ASCII URL. Length covers index byte + URL bytes (no terminator) |
| `0x06` | end marker | 4-byte length (always `04`) + 4-byte LE u32 total channel count |

### Channel entry shape

Each `0x04` entry encodes one channel:

```
[0x04] [size_LE: u32] [ch_idx: u8] [url: ASCII bytes]
                                   └ no NUL terminator; URL length = size - 1
```

URLs follow the `v1/gameData/...` namespace (see
[`../telemetry/channels.md`](../telemetry/channels.md) § Namespace
distribution). Examples: `v1/gameData/Rpm`, `v1/gameData/Brake`,
`v1/gameData/CurrentLapTime`.

### Channel indexing

- Index `0` is **reserved for padding** — sent on session 0x01
  device-description but never re-used here on session 0x02.
- Real channels start at index `1`.
- Indices are **1-based** and assigned **alphabetically by URL** across
  all channels the wheel knows. A wheel may have channels indexed
  1..16, 1..20, etc. depending on what its firmware ships with.

### Observed catalogs

| Wheel | Channel count | Channels |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| VGS | 16 | BestLapTime, Brake, CurrentLapTime, DrsState, ErsState, FuelRemainder, GAP, Gear, LastLapTime, Rpm, SpeedKmh, Throttle, TyreWearFL, TyreWearFR, TyreWearRL, TyreWearRR |
| CSP | 20 | (VGS list +) ABSActive, ABSLevel, TCActive, TCLevel, TyrePressureFL, TyrePressureFR, TyrePressureRL, TyrePressureRR, TyreTempFL, TyreTempFR, TyreTempRL, TyreTempRR |

The catalog tells the host **what the currently-loaded dashboard
subscribes to**, not the union of all dashboards the wheel could ever
load. Switching dashboards changes the catalog the wheel advertises on
the next connect.

### Worked example: VGS BestLapTime entry

```
04                                — tag
14 00 00 00                       — size = 20 (= 1 byte index + 19 byte URL)
01                                — ch_index = 1
76 31 2f 67 61 6d 65 44 61 74     "v1/gameDat"
61 2f 42 65 73 74 4c 61 70 54     "a/BestLapT"
69 6d 65                          "ime"
```

(URL length: 19 bytes; total entry: 20 bytes after the 5-byte tag/length
prefix → 25-byte TLV entry on wire.)

### Plugin consumption

[`TelemetrySender.WheelChannelCatalog`](../../../Telemetry/TelemetrySender.cs)
parses this stream during preamble and exposes the resulting URL list to
the UI. The list is also used by `FilterProfileToCatalog` to drop tier
entries whose URL doesn't appear in the wheel's advertised set, with
last-path-segment fallback (case-insensitive). See
[`../plugin/tier-impl.md`](../plugin/tier-impl.md).

### Cross-references

- [`handshake.md`](handshake.md) — when this stream arrives in the
  bidirectional sequence
- [`version-0-url-csp.md`](version-0-url-csp.md) — host echoes this same
  TLV format back to CSP wheels as the v0 subscription confirmation
- [`version-2-compact-vgs.md`](version-2-compact-vgs.md) — VGS uses a
  different compact host response that encodes compression and bit
  widths instead of URLs
