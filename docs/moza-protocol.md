# Moza Racing serial protocol

> **Disclaimer:** This document is a work in progress. It may contain errors, inconsistencies, omissions, or factually incorrect information. Research into the telemetry packet structure is ongoing.

## Frame format

```
7E  [N]  [group]  [device]  [payload: N bytes]  [checksum]
```

| Field | Size | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Start | 1 | Always `0x7E` |
| N | 1 | Byte count of payload only (excludes group, device, checksum) |
| Group | 1 | Request group / command category |
| Device | 1 | Target device ID on the internal serial bus |
| Payload | N | Command ID (1+ bytes) followed by value bytes |
| Checksum | 1 | See below |

Command IDs that are arrays of integers must be provided sequentially in order. Values are big-endian. Multiple frames can be concatenated in a single USB bulk transfer.

### Checksum

`checksum = (0x0D + sum of all preceding bytes including 0x7E) % 256`

The magic value 13 (`0x0D`) incorporates the USB endpoint (`0x02`), transfer type (`0x03` for URB_BULK), and a length constant (`0x08`). Changing the magic value causes devices to not respond — likely a firmware quirk rather than intentional.

### Responses

| Field | Transform |
|-------|-----------|
| Group | Request group + `0x80` (MSB set) — e.g. request `0x21` → response `0xA1` |
| Device | Nibbles swapped — e.g. request `0x13` → response `0x31` |
| Payload length | Reflects response data size, not request size |

Write requests: response mirrors the request payload. Read requests: response contains the full stored value regardless of how many bytes the request sent (a 1-byte read probe returns a full 16-byte string).

### Command chaining

Multiple commands can be sent at once. Responses are **not guaranteed in request order** — match by group number.

---

## USB topology

Device: Moza composite USB device (VID `0x346E` PID `0x0006`).

| Interface | Type | Endpoints | Purpose |
|-----------|------|-----------|---------|
| MI_00 | USB serial (CDC) | 0x02 OUT / 0x82 IN | Moza protocol bus — all serial frames |
| MI_02 | HID | 0x03 OUT / 0x83 IN | Wheel axes/buttons (not telemetry) |

Device IDs (19=base, 20=dash, 23=wheel, etc.) are addresses on the internal serial bus routed through the wheelbase hub — not separate USB devices.

**All captured live telemetry is addressed to device 0x17 (wheel, ID 23).** No captures exist of telemetry being sent to device 0x14 (MDD / standalone dash).

---

## Device and command reference

See [serial.md](serial.md) for the full list of device IDs and commands.

### Authoritative source: rs21_parameter.db

The Pit House installation contains `bin/rs21_parameter.db` — a SQLite database with 919 commands across 23 groups. This is the canonical reference for all RS21 (sim racing) device commands, including command names, descriptions, request/response group encoding, payload sizes, data types, valid ranges, and EEPROM addresses. The `request_group` field encodes as a JSON array: first element is the protocol group byte, remaining elements are command ID bytes. Example: `[40, 2]` → group 0x28, cmd 0x02.

Commands NOT in the database (not in rs21_parameter.db; discovered via USB captures): identity queries (groups 7/8/15/16), music sub-commands (group 42), sequence counter (group 45), telemetry enable (group 65), and live telemetry stream (group 67/0x43).

---

## Heartbeat (group 0x00)

Sent to every known device ID (18–30) roughly once per second. Payload length 0. Purpose: keep-alive / presence check.

## Unsolicited messages

- **Group 0x0E** from wheel (device 23): ASCII debug/log text, ~every 2s. Contains NRF radio stats, e.g. `NRFloss[avg:0.00000%] recvGap[avg:4.70100ms]`.
- **Group 0x06** from wheel (device 23): 12-byte hardware identifier. In `connect-wheel-start-game.json` this is host-initiated (part of the probe sequence), not purely unsolicited. VGS response: `be 49 30 02 14 71 35 04 30 30 33 37`.

---

## Wheel connection probe sequence

When a wheel is detected, Pithouse queries device 0x17 for identity. All identity strings are 16-byte null-padded ASCII.

Observed probe order (from `connect-wheel-start-game.json`): 0x09, 0x04, 0x06, 0x02, 0x05, 0x07, 0x0F, 0x11, 0x08, 0x10.

| Group | Cmd ID | Response | Notes |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| 0x09 | — (n=0) | 2 bytes (e.g. `00 01`) | **Presence/ready check** — sent first, before all other probes. Response may indicate sub-device count |
| 0x02 | — | 1 byte (e.g. `0x02`) | Possibly protocol version |
| 0x04 | `0x00` + 3 zero bytes | 4 bytes, per-model | VGS: `01 02 04 06`; Display sub-device: `01 02 08 06`. Byte 2 may encode device type (0x04=wheel, 0x08=display) |
| 0x05 | `0x00` + 3 zero bytes | 4 bytes, per-model | Capability flags? VGS: `01 02 1f 01`; CS V2.1: `01 02 26 00`; Display: `01 02 00 00` |
| 0x06 | — (n=0) | 12 bytes | Hardware identifier. VGS: `be 49 30 02 14 71 35 04 30 30 33 37` |
| 0x07 | `0x01` | 16-byte string | **Model name** — `VGS`, `CS V2.1` (see [known model names](#known-wheel-model-names)) |
| 0x08 | `0x01` | 16-byte string | **HW version** — `RS21-W08-HW SM-C` |
| 0x08 | `0x02` | 16-byte string | **HW revision** — `U-V12`, `U-V02` |
| 0x0F | `0x01` | 16-byte string | **FW version** — `RS21-W08-MC SW` |
| 0x10 | `0x00` | 16-byte string | **Serial number, first half** |
| 0x10 | `0x01` | 16-byte string | **Serial number, second half** |
| 0x11 | `0x04` | 2 bytes | Unknown |

Full serial = two halves concatenated (32 ASCII chars).

### Display sub-device (inside VGS wheel)

During dashboard upload, Pithouse runs the same identity probe sequence against a **Display** sub-module inside the wheel (routed via `0x43` frames). The Display has a distinct identity:

| Field | VGS (wheel) | Display (sub-module) |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| Model (0x07) | `VGS` | `Display` |
| HW version (0x08/01) | `RS21-W08-HW SM-C` | `RS21-W08-HW SM-D` |
| HW revision (0x08/02) | `U-V12` | `U-V14` |
| Caps (0x05) | `01 02 1f 01` | `01 02 00 00` |
| Type (0x04) byte 2 | `04` | `08` |
| Serial | (differs) | (differs) |

The SM-C/SM-D suffix distinguishes the main controller from the display controller. The Display sub-device has no capability flags (`00 00` vs `1f 01`).

### Known wheel model names

Model names confirmed from USB captures and live serial queries:

| Model name | Wheel | Source |
|------------|-------|--------|
| `VGS` | Vision GS | USB capture (`cs-to-vgs-wheel.ndjson`) |
| `CS V2.1` | CS V2 | USB capture (`vgs-to-cs-wheel.ndjson`) |

Model names assumed from device naming conventions (unverified):

| Prefix | Wheel | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| `GS V2P` | GS V2P | 10 button LEDs (5 per side), no flag LEDs |
| `CSP` | CS Pro | Has flag LEDs |
| `KSP` | KS Pro | Has flag LEDs |
| `FSR2` | FSR V2 | Has flag LEDs |

### ES wheel identity caveat

ES (old-protocol) wheels share device ID `0x13` with the wheelbase. Identity queries (group `0x07` etc.) sent to `0x13` return the **base** identity, not the wheel identity. For example, an ES wheel on an R5 base returns model name `R5 Black # MOT-1` — this is the base, not the wheel. There is currently no known way to query the ES wheel's own model name through the serial protocol.

---

## LED color commands

RPM and button LED colors use `wheel-telemetry-rpm-colors` and `wheel-telemetry-button-colors`. Fixed payload size of 20 bytes per chunk; colors split across multiple writes.

Each LED: 4 bytes `[index, R, G, B]`. Five LEDs per chunk (5 × 4 = 20). With 10 RPM LEDs = 2 chunks. With 14 button LEDs = 3 chunks (last padded to 20 bytes).

**Padding:** use index `0xFF` for unused entries, not `0x00`. Zero-padding creates `[0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00]` which the firmware interprets as "set LED 0 to black", causing flicker.

---

## RPM LED telemetry (group 0x3F, device 0x17, cmd `[0x1A, 0x00]`)

Sent ~once per second to the wheel. 8 data bytes = 4 × 16-bit LE values:

```
[current_pos, 0x0000, 0x03FF, 0x0000]
```

- `current_pos` = `current_rpm / max_rpm × 1023` — 10-bit RPM fraction
- Value 3 is always 1023 (fixed denominator)
- Values 2 and 4 are always 0

---

## Dash telemetry enable (group 0x41, device 0x17, cmd `[0xFD, 0xDE]`)

Sent ~100×/s. Data is always `00 00 00 00`. Likely a mode/enable flag — value 0 = telemetry active.

---

## Main real-time telemetry (group 0x43, device 0x17, cmd `[0x7D, 0x23]`)

Primary live data stream from Pithouse to wheel/dash. Sent ~17–20×/s.

### Frame structure

```
7E [N] 43 17  7D 23  [6-byte header]  [live data]  [checksum]
```

**Header** (6 bytes, after cmd ID):

| Byte | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| 0–3 | `32 00 23 32` | Constant across all captures |
| 4 | varies | **Flag byte** — determines payload type (see below) |
| 5 | `0x20` | Constant across all captures |

### Flag byte, payload types, and multi-stream architecture

Pit House sends telemetry as **three concurrent streams** using different flag bytes, one per `package_level` tier defined in `GameConfigs/Telemetry.json`. Each stream carries the channels assigned to its tier, bit-packed alphabetically by URL suffix.

| Flag offset | `package_level` | Update rate | Content |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|---------|
| base (e.g. `0x0a`, `0x13`) | 30 | ~30 ms | Channels with `package_level: 30` |
| base+1 | 500 | ~500 ms | Channels with `package_level: 500` |
| base+2 | 2000 | ~2000 ms | Channels with `package_level: 2000` |

`package_level` is the authoritative routing key — a channel's tier is fixed in `Telemetry.json`, independent of which dashboard is active. If a tier has no active channels, the frame is sent as a 2-byte stub `[flag][0x20]`. The flag value is a monotonic counter assigned per connection; base+1 and base+2 are always exactly one and two above the base flag.

### Level-2000 frame (base+2)

Channels with `package_level: 2000` in `Telemetry.json`. Packed using the same bit-packing algorithm and alphabetical channel ordering as the base frame. Example layout with 6 level-2000 channels (104 bits = 13 bytes):

| Bits | Channel | Compression | Width |
|------|---------|-------------|-------|
| 0–31 | BestLapTime | `float` | 32 |
| 32–63 | LastLapTime | `float` | 32 |
| 64–73 | TyreWearFrontLeft | `percent_1` | 10 |
| 74–83 | TyreWearFrontRight | `percent_1` | 10 |
| 84–93 | TyreWearRearLeft | `percent_1` | 10 |
| 94–103 | TyreWearRearRight | `percent_1` | 10 |
| *(total)* | | | **104 bits = 13 bytes exactly** |

### Level-500 frame (base+1)

Channels with `package_level: 500` in `Telemetry.json`. If a dashboard has no active level-500 channels, this frame is sent as a 2-byte stub `[flag][0x20]`.

### Payload size

Each stream's payload carries only the channels from that dashboard that belong to that `package_level` tier. Channels within each stream are packed **alphabetically by URL suffix**.

Total payload bytes = `ceil(sum_of_channel_bit_widths / 8)`.

Multi-channel payloads are **bit-packed** using per-channel compression types.

### Bit-packed encoding

Pithouse's `Telemetry.json` assigns each telemetry channel a `compression` type, which determines the bit width and encoding used in the telemetry stream.

#### Verified bit widths

The following bit widths are verified from USB capture analysis and Telemetry.json:

| Compression | Bits | Interface class | Value encoding |
|-------------|------|-----------------|----------------|
| `bool` | 1 | `BoolInterface` | 0 or 1 |
| `int30` | 5 | `Int30Interface` | Signed, values -1 to 30 (Gear uses offset: -1=R, 0=N, 1-12) |
| `uint30` / `uint31` | 5 | `Int30Interface` | Same 5-bit field, unsigned interpretation |
| `uint15` | 4 | `Int15Interface` | 0-14 valid; 15 = not available |
| `int8_t` / `uint8_t` | 8 | `Int8Interface` | Signed/unsigned byte |
| `float_001` | 10 | `NormalizedInterface` | 0-1000 valid, 1023 = N/A; encode: `raw = game × 1000`; decode: `game = raw / 1000` |
| `percent_1` | 10 | `PercentInterface` | 0-1000 valid, 1023 = N/A; encode: `raw = game% × 10`; decode: `game% = raw / 10` |
| `tyre_pressure_1` | 12 | `TyrePressureInterface` | encode: `raw = kPa × 10`; decode: `kPa = raw × 0.1`; range 0–409.5 kPa |
| `tyre_temp_1` / `track_temp_1` / `oil_pressure_1` | 14 | `TyreTempInterface` | encode: `raw = °C × 10 + 5000`; decode: `°C = (raw − 5000) × 0.1`; range −500–1138.3°C |
| `uint16_t` / `int16_t` | 16 | `Int16Interface` | Raw 16-bit integer |
| `float_6000_1` | 16 | `UFloatInterface` | encode: `raw = game × 10`; decode: `game = raw / 10`; range 0–6553.5 |
| `float_600_2` | 16 | `UFloatInterface` | encode: `raw = game × 100`; decode: `game = raw / 100`; range 0–655.35 |
| `brake_temp_1` | 16 | `BrakeTempInterface` | encode: `raw = °C × 10 + 5000`; decode: `°C = (raw − 5000) / 10`; range −500–6053.5°C |
| `uint24_t` | 24 | `UInt24Interface` | Raw 24-bit integer |
| `float` | 32 | `DoubleInterface` (flag=1) | Raw IEEE 754 single-precision float |
| `int32_t` / `uint32_t` | 32 | `Int32Interface` | Raw 32-bit integer |
| `double` / `int64_t` / `uint64_t` / `location_t` | 64 | `DoubleInterface` (flag=0) / `Int64Interface` | Raw 64-bit value |
| `uint3` | 4 | `Int15Interface` | 0-14 valid, 15 = N/A (same as `uint15`) |
| `uint8` | 4 | `Int15Interface` | 0-14 valid, 15 = N/A |

`DoubleInterface` has a flag byte at object offset +4: flag=1 returns 32-bit (used for `float` compression), flag=0 returns 64-bit (used for `double`).

Factory ID 20 (`uint3`, `uint8`, `uint15`) maps through abstract `IsUnsignedInterface` to `Int15Interface` (4 bits). The type name's number does NOT determine the bit width — all three use 4 bits.

#### Channel ordering

Channels are first grouped by **`package_level`** (30 → base frame, 500 → base+1, 2000 → base+2), then within each frame packed **alphabetically by URL suffix** (the part after `v1/gameData/`). Channels are iterated in sorted order by URL and packed sequentially into the bit stream starting at bit 0.

Bits are packed **LSB-first within each byte** (bit 0 = LSB of byte 0, bit 8 = LSB of byte 1, etc.). Multi-bit fields span byte boundaries when needed.

#### Example: F1 dashboard base frame (level-30 channels, alphabetical order)

Channels from the F1 dashboard with `package_level: 30`, sorted alphabetically by URL suffix, confirmed by capture (Gear at bit 79):

| Bits | Channel | Compression | Width |
|------|---------|-------------|-------|
| 0–9 | Brake | `float_001` | 10 |
| 10–41 | CurrentLapTime | `float` | 32 |
| 42 | DrsState | `bool` | 1 |
| 43–46 | ErsState | `uint3` | 4 |
| 47–78 | GAP | `float` | 32 |
| 79–83 | Gear | `int30` | 5 |
| 84–99 | Rpm | `uint16_t` | 16 |
| 100–115 | SpeedKmh | `float_6000_1` | 16 |
| 116–125 | Throttle | `float_001` | 10 |
| 126–127 | *(padding)* | | 2 |

## Telemetry startup sequence (from capture analysis)

Pit House sends several concurrent command streams when telemetry is active. Analysis of the `dash.ndjson` capture (which includes the pre-telemetry phase) shows the startup order:

### Concurrent outbound streams during active telemetry

| Stream | Rate | Device | Group/Cmd | Purpose | Required? |
|--------|------|--------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Sequence counter | ~45/s | base (0x13) | `0x2D/F5:31` | Frame sync to base | TBD |
| Telemetry enable | ~48/s | wheel (0x17) | `0x41/FD:DE` data=`00:00:00:00` | Mode/enable flag | Likely — runs entire session |
| **Live telemetry** | ~31/s | wheel (0x17) | `0x43/7D:23` | Bit-packed game data | Yes |
| Heartbeat | ~1/s each | all devices (18–30) | `0x00` n=0 | Keep-alive / presence check | Likely |
| RPM LED position | ~4/s | wheel (0x17) | `0x3F/1A:00` | LED bar position | Separate feature |
| Telemetry mode | ~3/s | wheel (0x17) | `0x40/28:02` data=`01:00` | Set/poll multi-channel mode | Likely |
| Dash keepalive | ~1.5/s | dash (0x14), dev21 (0x15) | `0x43` n=1, data=`00` | Dash/dev21 keep-alive | TBD |
| Display config | ~1/s | wheel (0x17) | `0x43/7C:27` | Page-cycled display params | TBD |
| Status push | ~1/s | wheel (0x17) | `0x43/FC:00` | Session acknowledgment (session byte must match telemetry flag byte) | Yes — wheel ignores session=0x00 |
| Settings block | ~1/s | wheel (0x17) | `0x43/7C:00` | Config sync | No (file transfer) |
| Button LED | ~1/s | wheel (0x17) | `0x3F/1A:01` | Button LED state | Separate feature |

### Startup timeline

From `dash.ndjson` (capture starts with telemetry already being set up):

| Time | Command | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| t=0.015 | `0x2D/F5:31` | Sequence counter starts immediately |
| t=0.022 | `0x41/FD:DE` | Enable signal starts (runs continuously at ~50/s) |
| t=0.032 | `0x00` heartbeat | First heartbeat to wheel |
| t=0.135 | `0x3F/1A:00` | First RPM LED update |
| t=0.150 | `0x00` heartbeat burst | Heartbeat to ALL devices |
| t=0.244 | `0x40/28:02 data=01:00` | Set telemetry mode to multi-channel |
| t=0.591 | `0x43/FC:00` | Status push |
| **t=0.672** | **`0x43/7D:23`** | **First live telemetry frame** |

The enable signal (`0x41`) runs from t=0.022 — **0.65 seconds before** the first telemetry frame. The telemetry mode set (`0x40/28:02 data=01:00`) runs from t=0.244.

### Telemetry preamble detail (from raw JSON, 2026-04-12)

From `moza-startup.json` (raw Wireshark JSON, not ndjson), the precise frame-by-frame startup sequence after Pithouse connects to a wheel is:

| Time | Frame | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| t=8.756 | `7c:00` type=0x81 session 0x01 + 0x02 | Opens two SerialStream sessions simultaneously |
| t=8.765 | (IN) `fc:00` session 0x01 ack + session 0x02 ack | Wheel accepts both sessions immediately |
| t=8.769 | (IN) `7c:00` data on sessions 0x01+0x02 | Wheel starts dumping channel registrations (v1/gameData/Rpm etc.) |
| t=8.809-8.843 | `fc:00` acks for session 0x02 (seq 04→17) | **Host acks each incoming data chunk** |
| t=8.820-8.826 | `7c:00` data TO wheel on session 0x02 | Host sends config data back to wheel |
| t=8.828 | **First `7d:23` telemetry** (flag=0x00, n=14) | Interleaved with fc:00 acks — smaller "probe" tier |
| t=8.857-9.758 | `7d:23` with flag=0x00 (~25 frames) | Continues at ~30Hz, no 0x41 enable yet |
| t=9.443-9.724 | Identity probes to wheel/base/pedals | Groups 0x00, 0x02-0x11 to devices 0x12, 0x13, 0x17 |
| t=9.810 | **First `0x41/FD:DE` enable** | **1.05s after session opens!** |
| t=9.845-9.866 | `0x40` channel config (0b:00, 09:00) | **1.1s after session opens** — deferred, not immediate |
| t=9.880-9.883 | `7c:00` more config data on session 0x02 | Additional config exchange |
| t=9.886 | **First `7d:23` with flag=0x02** (n=24) | Transitions to full telemetry — session data exchange complete |

**Key findings for plugin implementation:**
1. fc:00 acks for session 0x02 data are sent **during** the first second, interleaved with early telemetry
2. `0x41` enable signal does NOT start until ~1s after session opens — sending it immediately may interfere
3. `0x40` channel config (1E enables, 09:00) is sent AFTER the session data exchange, not before
4. Flag byte transitions from 0x00 (probe tier) to 0x02 (full tier) after session completes

### Full connect-to-telemetry timeline

From `connect-wheel-start-game.json` (capture starts with Pithouse running, no wheel connected, then wheel plugged in and Assetto Corsa started):

| Phase | Time | Events |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Idle** | t=0–7.8s | Heartbeats to all devices (~1/s each), `0x43` keepalive to dev20/21/23, `0x0E` debug poll to dev18/base. Only dev18, base(19), wheel(23) respond |
| **Wheel detected** | t=7.82s | Identity probe: 0x09 → 0x04 → 0x06 → 0x02 → 0x05 → 0x07 → 0x0F → 0x11 → 0x08 → 0x10 |
| **Config burst** | t=8.2–9.1s | ~50 `0x40` commands (channel enables, page config, LED config). `0x29` to base once. `0x40/28:02` polling starts at ~3 Hz |
| **Dashboard upload** | t=21.4–23.5s | `0x43/7c:00` chunked file transfer (~60 chunks). Display sub-device probed during transfer |
| **Pre-game steady state** | t=24–30.5s | `0x40/28:02` polling continues (response always `00:00`), heartbeats, keepalives. `0x28` queries to base at t=27.3s and t=29.3s |
| **Game starts** | t=30.568s | `0x41/FD:DE` enable (~48 Hz) and `0x2D/F5:31` seq counter (~47 Hz) start simultaneously |
| **First telemetry** | t=30.600s | `0x43/7D:23` live data begins (flag base=0x02). Level-500 is a 2-byte stub. ~31 frames/s steady state |
| **Data changes** | t=40.2s | Telemetry values begin changing (car on track after ~9.6s of loading) |

**Key observation:** The `0x40/28:02 data=01:00` polling runs for ~22 seconds before the game starts, and the wheel **always responds `00:00`** (never `01:00`). Telemetry flows regardless. The wheel may not actually acknowledge this mode setting, or the response value has a different meaning than expected.

### SerialStream telemetry port (flag byte)

Pithouse's telemetry system runs over `MOZA::Protocol::SerialStreamManager`, a TCP-like reliable stream multiplexed over the serial connection. Each telemetry session opens a **port** on the wheel via a type=0x81 "session channel open" frame inside `0x43/7c:00`. The port number is then used as the **flag byte** in `7d:23` telemetry data frames (byte offset 10 in the raw frame).

**Port allocation uses a global monotonic counter** shared between host and wheel. Both sides allocate from the same counter space — the host picks low numbers (1, 2, 3...) while the wheel picks its own (6, 8, 9...). The next host allocation accounts for wheel-allocated ports (e.g. host session 3 gets port 0x0a because 3-9 were taken by the wheel). The counter resets on wheel power cycle.

**Observed session opens in `moza-startup.json` (2026-04-12, raw JSON):**

| Time | Source | Session byte | Port (payload) | Notes |
|------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| 8.756s | Host | 0x01 | 0x0001 | First host session (management/upload) |
| 8.756s | Host | 0x02 | 0x0002 | Second host session (telemetry config) |
| 11.102s | Wheel | 0x08 | 0x0008 | Wheel-initiated keepalive |
| 11.102s | Wheel | 0x09 | 0x0009 | Wheel-initiated configJson RPC |
| 11.187s | Host | 0x03 | 0x000a | Third host session — port 10, not 3! |
| 11.894s | Wheel | 0x06 | 0x0006 | Wheel-initiated keepalive |

Key insight: the **session byte** (chunk header) and **port number** (payload) are different for session 0x03 — the session byte is a host-local identifier, the port is globally allocated. For sessions 0x01 and 0x02 they happen to match because those are the first allocations after power-on.

**Observed flag bytes across captures (confirmed from raw JSON, not ndjson):**

| Capture | Flag | Verified from |
|---------|------|---------------|
| `moza-startup.json` (today) | 0x02 | Raw JSON — first port after power-on |
| `burn-tyres.json` | 0x0a | Raw JSON — later connection |
| `0-100redline-0-main-dash.json` | 0x13 | Raw JSON — even later connection |

**Pithouse startup flag transition:** Pithouse starts sending telemetry with **flag=0x00** (n=14, 6 data bytes — a smaller startup tier) for ~25 frames before transitioning to **flag=0x02** (n=24, 16 data bytes — the full dashboard tier) after its session 0x02 config exchange completes. The flag=0x00 frames may be a pre-session "probe" tier with a different channel layout.

**Session open frame format:**

```
7E 0A 43 17 7C 00 [session] 81 [port_lo] [port_hi] [port_lo] [port_hi] FD 02 [checksum]
                   └─chunk ID   └─seq(LE)=port       └─session_id(LE)   └─window=765
```

Pithouse opens **two sessions simultaneously** (0x01 and 0x02) in the same USB packet. The wheel responds with `fc:00` acks for both. The `fc:00` session bytes in steady state track the **session ack protocol** (incrementing ack_seq for each 7c:00 data chunk received), NOT the telemetry flag byte.

**Current plugin approach:** The plugin implements the observed Pithouse preamble sequence:
1. Opens sessions 0x01 and 0x02 via type=0x81 frames (byte-identical to Pithouse)
2. Subscribes to incoming `MessageReceived` to ack session 0x02 channel data with fc:00
3. Waits ~1 second for the session data exchange to complete (heartbeats only during this period)
4. Sends 0x40 channel config burst (1E enables, 09:00, 28:02)
5. Begins 0x41 enable signal and 7d:23 telemetry with flag=0x02

This matches Pithouse's observed timing: session opens first, ~1s of session data exchange with acks, then channel config, then telemetry+enable. The ~1s preamble delay is required — Pithouse does not send 0x41 or 0x40 until after the session exchange.

**Port probing:** The plugin probes for available ports by sending type=0x81 session opens starting from port 1, waiting ~80ms for an fc:00 ack on each. The first two ports that respond become the management and telemetry sessions. The telemetry session's port becomes the FlagByte. This handles any counter state — whether the wheel was just powered on (ports 1-2 available) or Pithouse has run (ports 1-N consumed, the next free port is found automatically). The probe adds ~100-400ms to startup depending on how many ports must be skipped.

### Minimum viable sender

The `cs-to-vgs-wheel.ndjson` capture shows that Pit House sends the `0x40` channel configuration burst on every wheel connection, even without a dashboard upload. This suggests the wheel may require channel declarations before accepting telemetry.

**Recommended startup sequence:**

1. **Session open** (`0x43/7C:00` type=0x81): open SerialStream sessions — Pithouse opens two (0x01 + 0x02) simultaneously. No SYN handshake needed; the wheel accepts immediately and responds with `fc:00` acks. The telemetry session's port number becomes the flag byte for all `7d:23` frames
2. **Tier definition** (`0x43/7C:00` data chunks on telemetry session): send the tier definition message describing the bit layout for each flag byte — channel indices, compression codes, bit widths. Without this, the wheel cannot decode `7d:23` telemetry frames. See § Tier definition protocol
3. **Ack channel data** (`0x43/FC:00`): ack the wheel's channel registration responses on the telemetry session with incrementing `ack_seq`
4. **Channel configuration** (`0x40`): send `1e:00`/`1e:01` for each channel in the dashboard, plus `09:00`, page config (`1c`, `1d`), and `28:02 data=0100` — deferred ~1s after session open
3. **Telemetry enable** (`0x41/FD:DE data=00:00:00:00`): start sending at ~30+ Hz, runs the entire session
4. **Live telemetry** (`0x43/7D:23`): bit-packed frames at ~20-30 Hz
5. **Sequence counter** (`0x2D/F5:31`): incrementing counter to base at ~30+ Hz
6. **Telemetry mode polling** (`0x40/28:02 data=01:00`): ~3 Hz
7. **Heartbeat** (`0x00` n=0): to all devices 18–30, ~1/s
8. **Dash keepalive** (`0x43` n=1 data=`00`): to devices 0x14, 0x15, ~1/s
9. **Display config** (`0x43/7C:27`): page-cycled params, ~1/s
10. **Status push** (`0x43/FC:00`): zero data (session ack protocol not implemented), ~1/s

The RPM LEDs work with zero preamble — `0x3F/1A:00` data is accepted immediately.

**Critical prerequisite:** Pit House must have already uploaded a dashboard to the wheel. The `0x41/FD:DE` enable signal is likely required — Pithouse sends it at ~48 Hz for the entire session, starting simultaneously with (or slightly before) the first telemetry frame.

## Other periodic commands

### Group 0x40 (host → device 0x17)

**Normal operation (~3.4 Hz):** `28 02 XX 00` — byte 2 varies by dashboard type (`01` with 16-channel, `00` with 1-channel).

**Dashboard upload:** burst of 18+ distinct payloads including channel enable/disable (`1E [0/1] [ch]`), page config (`1B [page] FF`), and various sub-commands.

### Group 0x2D (host → device 0x13, ~50 Hz)

Cmd `[0xF5, 0x31]`. Data: `00 00 00 XX` where XX increments by 1 each send. Sequence counter for the base unit.

### Group 0x0E poll (host → device 0x13, ~1 Hz)

3-byte payload `00 01 XX` with 16-bit BE countdown counter starting at 0x013A (314). Base echoes back + 4 unknown bytes.

### Group 0x1F (host → device 0x12, ~3 Hz)

`4F XX 00/01` where XX cycles `08`→`09`→`0A`→`0B`. Response inserts `0xFF` status byte.

### Group 0x28 (host → device 0x13, occasional)

Queries device parameters from the base unit. Request format: `[sub_id] 00 00`. Response mirrors sub_id with 2 data bytes.

Observed in `connect-wheel-start-game.json` (sent twice, ~2s apart):

| Sub-cmd | Response value | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| `0x01` | `01 C2` (450) | Base parameter |
| `0x17` | `01 C2` (450) | Wheel (device 0x17) parameter — possibly FFB strength/range |
| `0x02` | `03 E8` (1000) | Base parameter |

### Group 0x29 (host → device 0x13, once during config)

Sent once during dashboard config burst. Payload: `13 04 4C` (device 0x13, value 1100). Response mirrors exactly. Possibly a timing/rate setting for the base.

### Group 0x2B (host → device 0x13, occasional)

`02 00 00`, sent on state changes (pause, session end).

### Group 0x43 sub-commands (device 0x17)

| Cmd ID | Data | Frequency | Notes |
|--------|------|-----------|-------|

### Group 0x43 broadcast (devices 0x14, 0x15)

Short (length=2) packets to dash (device 20) and device 21 every ~5s. Heartbeat/sync.

---

## Dashboard upload protocol (group 0x43, cmd `7c:00`)

Pit House transfers dashboard files and configuration to the wheel using a proprietary TCP-like serial stream protocol (`MOZA::Protocol::SerialStreamManager`) over `0x43/7c:00`. The `fc:00` command is used for acknowledgments. This is NOT CoAP — CoAP is a separate layer used for device parameter management.

### Chunk format

Each `7c:00` data field contains one chunk:

```
session(1)  type(1)  seq_lo(1)  seq_hi(1)  payload(≤58)
```

| Field | Size | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| session | 1 | Session ID — pre-assigned, multiple concurrent sessions |
| type | 1 | `0x01` = data, `0x00` = control/end marker, `0x81` = session channel open (device-initiated) |
| seq | 2 LE | Sequence number (monotonic within session) |
| payload | ≤58 | Net data per chunk; **non-last data chunks have a 4-byte CRC-32 trailer** |

Net payload per full data chunk: **54 bytes** (58 minus 4-byte CRC). The last chunk in a transfer has no CRC trailer.

Acknowledgment packets use `fc:00` with 3 bytes: `session(1) + ack_seq(2 LE)`. The session ID in the ack identifies the **ack sender's** session, not the data sender's. Linked session pairs (e.g. 0x03↔0x0A) use cross-session acks.

### CRC algorithm

**Standard CRC-32** (ISO 3309 / ITU-T V.42, same as zlib/Ethernet/gzip/PNG):
- Polynomial: `0x04C11DB7` (reflected), init `0xFFFFFFFF`, xor-out `0xFFFFFFFF`
- Stored **little-endian** in the 4-byte trailer
- Covers only the **54-byte payload data** (excludes session/type/seq header)
- Per-chunk (not cumulative across chunks)
- Computable via `zlib.crc32(payload_bytes)` or `System.IO.Hashing.Crc32`

### Type 0x81 — session channel open

Device sends type `0x81` to initiate or acknowledge a session. Payload is 4 bytes:

```
session_id(2 LE)  receive_window(2 LE)
```

Observed: `04 00 fd 02` → session 4, window 765.

### Compressed transfer format

Zlib-compressed transfers (RPC messages, file contents) prepend a 9-byte header to the reassembled application data:

```
flags(1)  comp_sz(4 LE)  uncomp_sz(4 LE)  [zlib data...]
```

The zlib stream uses standard deflate (`78 9c` magic). Reassembly: strip the 4-byte CRC from each non-last chunk, concatenate all chunk payloads (excluding session/type/seq headers), then parse the 9-byte header and decompress `comp_sz` bytes.

### Concurrent session map (observed in `dash-upload.ndjson`)

8 concurrent sessions run during a single dashboard upload:

| Session | Duration | Role | Description |
|---------|----------|------|-------------|
| 0x01 | 8.5s | Management | Bidirectional RPCs with `0xFF`-prefixed messages (see below) |
| 0x02 | 6.9s | Keepalive | Dev→host, empty `00 00 00 00`, ~3.4s interval |
| 0x03 | 6.9s | Keepalive | Host→dev, linked to 0x0A via cross-session acks |
| 0x04 | 3.0s | **File transfer** | Path exchange + mzdash upload (75 data + 28 ack chunks) |
| 0x06 | 6.9s | Keepalive | Alternating directions, ~3.4s |
| 0x08 | 6.9s | Keepalive | Alternating directions, ~3.4s |
| 0x09 | 5.8s | **configJson RPC** | Dev sends dashboard state; host responds with dashboard list |
| 0x0A | 6.9s | Keepalive | Dev→host, linked to 0x03 |

Additionally, bare `0x43` frames (no cmd bytes, n=1, payload=`0x00`) are sent to devices 0x17/0x14/0x15 every ~1.1s as connection-level keepalive pings. Device replies `0x80`.

### Session 1 — management messages

Management RPCs use a `0xFF`-prefixed envelope:

```
FF(1)  inner_len(4 LE)  token(4 LE)  data(inner_len)  CRC32(4)
```

The token links requests to responses. Multi-chunk messages also have per-chunk CRC trailers. The message at t=5.2s in the capture carries a zlib-compressed device log (7163 bytes, UTF-16BE) listing all installed dashboards and rendering status.

### File transfer sequence (observed in `dash-upload.ndjson`)

The upload of a dashboard file involves multiple sessions and a post-transfer configuration burst:

**1. File path exchange + content push (session 4)**

The device initiates with a type=0x81 channel open. The host then sends two sub-messages:

**Sub-message 1 — path registration (no file content):**

```
header(8)
  TLV paths (0x8C=local, 0x84=remote)
  MD5_len(1=0x10) + MD5(16)
  reserved(4=0x00000000)
  token(4)
  sentinel(4=0xFFFFFFFF)
```

**Sub-message 2 — file content push:**

```
header(8)
  TLV paths (0x8C=local, 0x84=remote)
  MD5_len(1=0x10) + MD5(16)
  reserved(4)
  token(4) + token(4)
  file_count(4)
  dest_path_byte_len(4)
  dest_path(UTF-16BE, null-terminated)
  compressed_header + zlib_stream
```

**8-byte transfer header:**

| Byte | Host→dev | Dev→host | Meaning |
|------|----------|----------|---------|
| 0 | `0x02` | `0x01` | Sender role (0x02=host, 0x01=device) |
| 1 | `0x40` (64) | `0x38` (56) | Max chunk payload size |
| 2 | `0x01` | `0x01` | Transfer type (0x01=file transfer) |
| 3–7 | zeros | zeros | Reserved |

**TLV path markers:**

| Marker | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `0x8C` | Local path (host-side temp file) |
| `0x84` | Remote path (device-side staging or target) |

Each entry: `marker(1) + 0x00(1) + UTF-16LE_path(null-terminated)`. Scan to null terminator for length.

Host paths: `C:/Users/.../AppData/Local/Temp/_moza_filetransfer_tmp_{timestamp}`
Device staging: `/home/root/_moza_filetransfer_md5_{md5hex}`
Device target: `/home/moza/resource/dashes/{name}/{name}.mzdash`

Note: TLV paths use UTF-16LE, but the destination path in sub-message 2 uses **UTF-16BE**.

The file content (mzdash JSON) is zlib-compressed and embedded after the destination path.

End-to-end file integrity uses **MD5** (transmitted alongside paths). The on-device staging file is named after the MD5 hash.

**Session 4 sequence diagram:**

```
Device                                     Host
  │ ──── type=0x81 (channel open) ────────→  │  seq=0x0004
  │ ←─── fc:00 ACK ──────────────────────    │
  │ ←─── Sub-msg 1: path registration ───    │  7 chunks
  │ ──── fc:00 ACKs ─────────────────────→   │
  │ ──── Sub-msg 1 response (echo paths) ─→  │  6 chunks
  │ ←─── Sub-msg 2: file content push ───    │  32 chunks
  │ ──── fc:00 ACKs ─────────────────────→   │
  │ ──── Sub-msg 2 response ─────────────→   │  6 chunks
  │ ←─── type=0x00 end marker ───────────    │
  │ ──── type=0x00 end marker ───────────→   │
```

**2. Dashboard config RPC (session 9, compressed transfer)**

Host sends a `configJson()` message listing all dashboards:
```json
{"configJson()":{"dashboards":["Formula 1","GT V01",...,"rpm-only"],
  "dashboardRootDir":"","fontRootDir":"","fonts":[],"imageRootDir":"","sortTags":0},"id":11}
```

Device responds with dashboard management state:
```json
{"TitleId":4,"disabledManager":{"deletedDashboards":[],
  "updateDashboards":[{"createTime":"...","dirName":"rpm-only",
  "hash":"..."}]}}
```

**3. Channel configuration burst (group 0x40, after file transfer)**

After the file is transferred, Pit House sends a burst of `0x40` commands to configure the wheel's channel layout:

| Cmd | Data | Purpose |
|-----|------|---------|
| `09:00` | (none) | Begin/reset channel config |
| `1e:01` | `CC 00 00` | Enable channel CC on page 1 |
| `1e:00` | `CC 00 00` | Enable channel CC on page 0 |
| `1c:00`/`1c:01` | `00` | Page configuration |
| `1d:00`/`1d:01` | `00` | Page configuration |
| `28:02` | `01 00` | Set multi-channel telemetry mode |
| various | — | Display settings (`0a`, `0b`, `05`, `1b`, `20`, `21`, `24`, etc.) |

**4. Periodic display config (group 0x43, cmd `7c:27`)**

Sent ~1/s after the dashboard is active. Two payloads per page, cycling through all dashboard pages. Values are **page-derived**, confirmed across 1-page (rpm-only) and 3-page (F1) dashboards:

| Page `p` | 8-byte payload | 4-byte payload |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| 0 | `0f 80 05 00 03 00 fe 01` | `0f 00 06 00` |
| 1 | `0f 80 07 00 05 00 fe 01` | `0f 00 08 00` |
| 2 | `0f 80 09 00 07 00 fe 01` | `0f 00 0a 00` |
| Formula | `0f 80 (5+2p) 00 (3+2p) 00 fe 01` | `0f 00 (6+2p) 00` |

Bytes `0f`, `80`/`00`, `fe 01` are constant. The page count equals the mzdash `children` array length.

A one-shot `7c:23` command is sent when a dashboard is first activated, with 8 bytes of display parameters.

### Wheel connection initialization (from `cs-to-vgs-wheel.ndjson`)

When a wheel connects (or is swapped), Pit House runs the full identity probe followed by a channel configuration burst — even without a dashboard upload. This was captured during a CS → VGS wheel swap:

1. **Identity probe** (groups 0x02–0x11): model name, HW/FW version, serial
2. **LED config** (`0x3f`): sleep color, sleep mode
3. **Channel configuration burst** (`0x40`): same commands as the post-upload burst:
   - `1e:01`/`1e:00 data=CC0000` — declare channel CC for page 0/1; wheel responds with `CC XXXX` (stored value, e.g. `01f4`=500, `03e8`=1000, `0bb8`=3000). These configure the telemetry stream, not the display — the CS V2.1 (no screen, RPM LEDs and buttons only) receives the same channel config as the VGS (built-in screen). Channel indices and response values are dashboard-specific
   - `1c`, `1d` — page config
   - `09:00` — config mode (response `09:28`)
   - `1b:00`/`1b:01` — brightness per page
   - `28:02 data=0100` — set multi-channel telemetry mode
   - `1f:00`/`1f:01` — LED color writes per index
4. **`0x0e` parameter polling**: reads wheel EEPROM registers (indices 0x01–0x14, then 0x2c+)
5. **`28:02 data=0100`** continues polling ~every 300ms after the burst

The wheel's `0x0e` debug log confirms channel config commands write to EEPROM: `"Table 2, Param 47 Written: 7614374"`.

**No `7c:00` file transfer or `configJson()` RPC occurs** — Pit House does not ask the wheel which dashboard it has active. It pushes the channel layout from its own internal state. The `0xc0/13:00` response `00 ff ff` during setup may indicate "no active dashboard" or a default state.

**Implication for SimHub plugin**: the channel configuration burst appears to be required on each wheel connection before telemetry frames will be accepted. Simply sending `7d:23` frames to a freshly connected wheel may not work without first sending the `0x40` channel enables and `28:02 data=0100`.

### Key constants

| Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| 10.0 | Scale factor for percent, UFloat, temps, pressures (×10) |
| 100.0 | Normalized → percent conversion (×100 then ×10) |

### UFloatInterface scale factor

UFloatInterface reads a per-instance exponent from `this+8`. The scale factor is `10^exponent`:
- `float_6000_1`: exponent=1 → scale=10 → range 0–6553.5
- `float_600_2`: exponent=2 → scale=100 → range 0–655.35

The type name encodes `float_{max}_{decimal_places}`: `float_6000_1` means max ~6000 with 1 decimal place.

## ServiceParameter value transforms (rs21_parameter.db)

The `ServiceParameter` table in `rs21_parameter.db` documents how raw **device setting** values (groups 31–100) map to display units. These are separate from the telemetry encoding above — they apply to Pit House's settings UI, NOT to the telemetry bit stream.

| Function | Params | Example | Meaning |
|----------|--------|---------|---------|
| `multiply` | `0.01` | FFB strength 0–10000 → 0–100% | Raw value × 0.01 |
| `multiply` | `0.1` | Temperature raw → degrees | Raw value × 0.1 |
| `multiply` | `0.05` | Step values | Raw value × 0.05 |
| `multiply` | `2` | Some parameters | Raw value × 2 |
| `division` | `65535` | Normalize 16-bit | Raw value / 65535 → 0.0–1.0 |
| `division` | `16384` | Normalize 14-bit | Raw value / 16384 → 0.0–1.0 |
| `softLimitStiffness_conversion` | — | Soft limit stiffness | Custom non-linear conversion |

## EEPROM direct access (group 0x0A / 10)

Low-level EEPROM read/write protocol, applicable to any device. Bypasses the named command interface. Found in rs21_parameter.db but not observed in USB captures. See [serial.md § EEPROM direct access](serial.md#eeprom-direct-access-group-0x0a--10--any-device) for the command table.

EEPROM tables: 2=Base (38 params), 3=Motor (76 params, PID/encoder/field-weakening), 4=Wheel (123 params), 5=Pedals (45 params), 11=Unknown (8 params).

## Base ambient LED control (groups 0x20/0x22 — 32/34)

Controls 2 LED strips (9 LEDs each) on the wheelbase body. Group 32 = write, group 34 = read. Sent to the main device (0x12). Found in rs21_parameter.db but not observed in USB captures. See [serial.md § base ambient LEDs](serial.md#group-0x20--0x22-32--34--base-ambient-leds) for the command table.

## Wheel LED group architecture (groups 0x3F/0x40 — 63/64, extended)

The rs21_parameter.db reveals that newer wheels organize LEDs into **5 independently controlled groups**. See [serial.md § extended LED group architecture](serial.md#extended-led-group-architecture-groups-0x3f--0x40) for all per-group commands and additional newer wheel commands.

| Group ID | Name | Max LEDs | Purpose |
|----------|------|----------|---------|
| 0 | Shift | 25 | RPM indicator bar |
| 1 | Button | 16 | Button backlights |
| 2 | Single | 28 | Single-purpose status indicators |
| 3 | Rotary | 56 | Rotary encoder ring LEDs |
| 4 | Ambient | 12 | Ambient / underglow lighting |

## Telemetry channel census (Telemetry.json)

The master channel list `bin/GameConfigs/Telemetry.json` defines 410 channels. Key distribution:

| Namespace | Count | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| `v1/gameData/` | 275 | Standard game telemetry |
| `v1/gameData/patch/` | 133 | Extended: 64 track map coordinates, 64 race info slots, display names |
| `v1/preset/` | 2 | Device state: `CurrentTorque` and `SteeringWheelAngle` (both `float_6000_1`, 16 bits) |

The `v1/preset/` channels are NOT game telemetry — they reflect the wheelbase's own state.

### Full compression type census

| Compression | Count | Bits | Encode | Primary use |
|-------------|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| `float` | 73 | 32 | IEEE 754 single | Lap times, delta, torque, fuel |
| `location_t` | 65 | 64 | IEEE 754 double | Track position coordinates |
| `uint32_t` | 65 | 32 | raw | Race info slots |
| `bool` | 51 | 1 | 0/1 | Flags, states, lights |
| `tyre_temp_1` | 43 | 14 | °C×10+5000 | Tyre temperatures |
| `percent_1` | 19 | 10 | %×10 | Throttle, brake, clutch, fuel, tyre wear |

## Internal bus topology (monitor.json)

The `monitor.json` file in the Pit House installation defines the device tree for each base model. These are **internal bus IDs**, not the serial protocol device IDs. The mapping between bus IDs and protocol device IDs is: bus 2 → main (0x12), bus 3 → base (0x13), bus 4 → wheel (0x17), bus 5 → dash (0x14), etc.

Common topology (single-controller bases):
```
1 (USB host)
└── 2 (Main controller / hub)
    ├── 3 (Motor controller)
    ├── 4 (Wheel) ── 18 (Wheel display unit)
    ├── 5 (Dashboard) ── 17 (Dash sub-device)
    ├── 6..12 (Peripheral ports)
    ├── 13, 14 (children of 9)
    └── 16 (child of 7)
```

D11 (R21/R25/R27 Ultra) omits bus 5; S09 CM2 dash connects as bus 19 directly off bus 2.

## Setting value encoding notes

Several configuration commands use non-obvious value encoding. Confirmed by cross-referencing Pithouse USB captures with the foxblat source.

### Wheel settings (group 0x3F/0x40, device 0x17)

| Command | ID | Raw values | Notes |
|---------|-----|-----------|-------|
| paddles-mode | `03` | 1=Buttons, 2=Combined, 3=Split | **1-based**, not 0-based. Sending 0 is invalid and causes the firmware to break all paddle input including shift paddles |
| stick-mode | `05` | 0=Buttons, 256=D-Pad | 2-byte field; D-Pad mode sets the high byte (`0x0100`) |
| rpm-indicator-mode | `04` | 1=RPM, 2=Off, 3=On | **1-based** (wheel only) |

### Dashboard settings (group 0x32/0x33, device 0x14)

| Command | ID | Raw values | Notes |
|---------|-----|-----------|-------|
| rpm-indicator-mode | `11 00` | 0=Off, 1=RPM, 2=On | **0-based** — different from wheel |
| flags-indicator-mode | `11 02` | 0=Off, 1=Flags, 2=On | **0-based** |

Note: the wheel and dashboard use different base indices for indicator modes (wheel is 1-based, dashboard is 0-based).

See [serial.md](serial.md) and [serial.yml](serial.yml) for the full command tables.

## Telemetry data verification (2026-04-12)

Complete byte-level verification of the telemetry data frames confirmed:

**Frame structure:** Header `7E [N] 43 17 7D 23 32 00 23 32 [flag] 20 [data] [checksum]` — all constant bytes, N computation, and checksum algorithm match Pithouse captures exactly. Verified checksums for session opens, mode frames, enable frames, and telemetry frames all produce byte-identical results to Pithouse.

**Bit-packing:** LSB-first algorithm in `TelemetryBitWriter` is correct. Channel sort order (case-insensitive by URL) matches the order observed in Pithouse captures. Decoding Pithouse telemetry data with the plugin's channel layout yields plausible game values (gears 0-6, RPM 0-7000, speed 0-260, brake/throttle 0-1).

**Encoding formulas:** All verified against capture data — `float_001` (×1000), `percent_1` (×10), `uint16_t` (direct), `float_6000_1` (×10), `int30` (5-bit, -1→31), `float` (IEEE 754), `bool` (0/1).

**F1 dashboard tier layout (3 tiers, all sizes match Pithouse):**

| Tier | Flag | Channels | Bits | Bytes | Pithouse bytes |
|------|------|----------|------|-------|---------------|
| Level 30 | 0x02 | Brake, CurrentLapTime, DrsState, ErsState, GAP, Gear, Rpm, SpeedKmh, Throttle | 126→128 | 16 | 16 ✓ |
| Level 500 | 0x03 | FuelRemainder | 10→16 | 2 | 2 ✓ |
| Level 2000 | 0x04 | BestLapTime, LastLapTime, TyreWear×4 | 104 | 13 | 13 ✓ |

**Bugs found and fixed:**
1. The `.mzdash` regex parser failed to match escaped-quote URLs (`Telemetry.get(\"v1/gameData/FuelRemainder\")`), silently dropping FuelRemainder (level-500 tier). This caused tier-to-flag misalignment: the plugin sent 13-byte level-2000 data on flag=0x03 where the wheel expected 2-byte level-500 data.
2. The plugin never sent the **tier definition message** — a critical 7c:00 data exchange on the telemetry session that tells the wheel firmware how to decode each flag byte's bit-packed data (channel indices, compression codes, bit widths per tier). Without this, the wheel cannot interpret 7d:23 frames at all. See § Tier definition protocol below.

## Tier definition protocol (group 0x43, session data on 7c:00)

Pithouse sends a tier definition message to the wheel as 7c:00 data chunks (type=0x01) on the telemetry session during the first ~1s preamble. This message describes the exact bit layout for each flag byte, enabling the wheel firmware to decode the packed telemetry data.

**Message format** (decoded from raw capture `moza-startup.json` 2026-04-12, sub-message 2, seq 8-16):

```
[0x00] [01 00 00 00] [flag_offset]           — tier enable (repeated per tier)
[0x01] [size: u32 LE] [flag_byte]            — tier definition header
  [ch_index: u32 LE] [comp: u32 LE]         — 16-byte channel entry (repeated)
  [bits: u32 LE]     [reserved: u32 LE]
[0x06] [04 00 00 00] [total_channels: u32 LE] — end marker
```

**Channel indices** are 1-based, assigned alphabetically by URL across all tiers (not per-tier).

**Compression codes** (confirmed from capture):

| Code | Type | Bits | Code | Type | Bits |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| 0x00 | bool | 1 | 0x07 | float | 32 |
| 0x04 | uint16_t | 16 | 0x0D | int30 | 5 |
| 0x0E | percent_1 | 10 | 0x0F | float_6000_1 | 16 |
| 0x14 | uint3 | 4 | 0x17 | float_001 | 10 |

**Chunking:** The message is sent as SerialStream data chunks with CRC-32 trailers (standard ISO 3309). Max 54 net bytes per non-last chunk (58 with CRC). The last chunk has no CRC.

**Verified:** The plugin's `TierDefinitionBuilder` generates tier definitions byte-identical to Pithouse for the F1 dashboard: same channel indices, compression codes, and bit widths across all 3 tiers.

## Open questions

- ~~Value scaling for specialized types~~ — **RESOLVED**: All conversion formulas determined. Key insight: the `percent_1` scale factor is exactly 10.0 (not 10.22 as previously estimated from capture data)
- ~~CRC algorithm~~ — **RESOLVED**: Standard CRC-32 (ISO 3309), same as `zlib.crc32()`. Little-endian, covers 54-byte payload only. See § Dashboard upload protocol.
- ~~File transfer header format~~ — **RESOLVED**: 8-byte header: role(1) + max_chunk_size(1) + transfer_type(1) + reserved(5). TLV paths use markers 0x8C (local) and 0x84 (remote) with UTF-16LE. See § Session 4 wire format in pithouse-re.md.
- ~~Session lifecycle~~ — **RESOLVED (2026-04-12, corrected)**: Sessions are opened via type=0x81 frames with port numbers from a global monotonic counter. Both host and device can open sessions. The host probes for available ports by sending type=0x81 and waiting for fc:00 acks. See § SerialStream telemetry port.
- ~~Protocol identity~~ — **RESOLVED**: The 0x43/7c:00 framing is `MOZA::Protocol::SerialStreamManager`, a proprietary TCP-like reliable stream. NOT CoAP. CoAP (libcoap 4.3.4) is a separate layer for device parameter management.
- ~~Flag byte / SerialStream port~~ — **RESOLVED (2026-04-12)**: See § SerialStream telemetry port. Plugin uses probe-based allocation.
- ~~Session ID / port allocation~~ — **RESOLVED (2026-04-12)**: Session IDs (chunk header byte) and port numbers (payload) are **independent**. Port counter is global and monotonic within a power cycle. Plugin probes from port 1 upward.
- ~~Tier definition protocol~~ — **RESOLVED (2026-04-12)**: Pithouse sends a tier definition message (channel indices, compression codes, bit widths) as 7c:00 data chunks on the telemetry session. The plugin generates byte-identical tier definitions via `TierDefinitionBuilder`. See § Tier definition protocol.
- ~~Gear encoding for reverse~~ — **RESOLVED**: `int30` is a signed 5-bit value: -1=R, 0=N, 1–12=gears. Reverse is stored as 31 (two's complement -1 in 5 bits).
- **Dashboard byte limit configuration** — stored at config object offset `+0x30`, set during dashboard upload (group 0x40). Exact mechanism for setting this limit not yet traced
- **Cold-start initialization** — `connect-wheel-start-game.json` captures wheel connection → game start, confirming the full init sequence (identity probe → config burst → dashboard upload → telemetry). EEPROM persistence across power cycles is confirmed for channel config; unclear for session state
- **MDD (standalone dash)** — no captures of telemetry sent to device 0x14; protocol may differ
- **Compression codes for non-F1 types** — 8 codes confirmed from capture (bool, uint3, int30, uint16_t, float, float_001, float_6000_1, percent_1). Codes for brake_temp_1, tyre_temp_1, tyre_pressure_1, track_temp_1, oil_pressure_1, float_600_2, location_t, int32_t, uint32_t, double, uint8_t are inferred but unverified. Need captures with dashboards that use these types
- **EEPROM direct access** — group 10 protocol found in rs21_parameter.db but never observed in USB captures; needs live verification
- **Base ambient LEDs** — groups 32/34 commands found in rs21_parameter.db; not captured in USB traces (requires base with LED strips)
- **Wheel LED groups 2-4** — Single, Rotary, and Ambient groups found in rs21_parameter.db with up to 56 LEDs; only groups 0 (Shift/RPM) and 1 (Button) confirmed in captures so far
- **Group 0x09 semantics** — presence/ready check sent first during probe. Response `00 01` may indicate sub-device count (VGS has 1 Display sub-device). Needs verification with other wheel models
- **Group 0x28 / 0x29 purpose** — group 0x28 queries base for per-device parameters (values 450, 1000 seen); group 0x29 sets a base parameter (value 1100). Possibly FFB or calibration related
- **0x40/28:02 response discrepancy** — wheel always responds `00:00` to `28:02 data=01:00` in `connect-wheel-start-game.json`, yet telemetry flows. May depend on timing or dashboard state
- **Display sub-device identity probe** — Pithouse probes a Display sub-module inside the wheel via 0x43 frames (commands 0x09, 0x04, 0x06, 0x02, 0x05, 0x07, 0x0F, 0x11, 0x08, 0x10) at ~t=9.97s. The plugin does not do this. Unknown whether it's required for telemetry or only for dashboard upload
- **SerialStream SYN handshake** — the three-way handshake (SYN1/SYN2/SYN3) is confirmed from binary strings but not observed in any capture. Type=0x81 session opens work without it — the SYN handshake may be a lower-level connection layer already established when the serial port opens
- **Group 0x0E debug poll** — Pithouse sends 158 of these during a session. The plugin sends none. Purpose unclear but may affect long-running session stability
